# Getting Started

## Build script 
If you simply want to build application.css once, just run the following command:

> npm run build

## Watch script
If you need to work with SASS and have it build automatically if any changes have been made, use the following command:

> npm run watch

## Folder structure
- **pages** - if you need to write any page specific SASS
- **patterns** - is where we create overrides on more granular level i.e. cards.scss

## Folder structure
When you name your sass files, please start with an underscore **"_"** i.e. "_header.scss"

# To do
Explore automation of the application.css build as part of the pipeline.
